## 3.09 Most Basic Type of Network


1. Networks vary in size from the largest, the internet, to the smallest, two
   computers connected by a cable, typical cat-5 utp (unshielded twisted pair).

2. A device must have a network interface card (NIC). This can be for ethernet,
   wireless, or optical. Older technologies such as 10Base5 and 10Base2
-  (now obsolete) using a coaxial _cable to parallel_ connector interface.

3. If a device does not have a built-in network interface card, a usb adaptor
   may be used.

4. Network interface cards or devices have a Media Access Control Address (MAC
   address), a unique identifier for use as a network address in communications
   within a network segment. This use is common in most IEEE 802 networking
   technologies, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.

5. Nowdays, wifi is the most prevalent interface for most portable devices.

6. The process of data transference from one device to another via radio waves
   (wifi) uses a process of Modulation. This is the process of varying one or
   more properties of a periodic waveform, referred to as a _carrier signal_,
   with a modulating signal that typical contains information to be
   transmitted.

7. Most radio systems in the 20th century used frequency modulation (FM) or
   amplitude modulation (AM) for radio broadcasts.
