## 3.12 Connector and Cable types


- Copper ethernet cables come in two types; straight-through and crossover.

- Straight-through cables are used to connect computers to network devices.
  Crossover cables are used to make computer to computer connections.

- Newer network interface cards have _Auto MDI-X_ ports which can detect if the
  connection would require a crossover, and automatically chooses the MDI of MDI-X
  configuration to properly match the other end of the link.

- Packet Tracer, however, still requires that crossover type cables are used for
  connecting computers (end devices) to one another.

- Crossover cables basically reverse the connections from one end of the cable to
  the other so that two NICs can be connected _back-to-back_.
