## 3.12* Practical Example - Packet Tracer


### MAC Addresses

1. MAC addresses are primarily assigned by device manufacturers, and are
   therefore often referred to as the _burned-in_ address, or as an Ethernet
   hardware address, hardware address, and physical address.

2. Each address can be stored in hardware, such as the cards' read-only memory,
   or by a firmware mechanism.

3. In Packet Tracer, the MAC address of network interface cards can be changed.
   This can make it easier to identify the various devices in a topology, and
   make the process of observation easier.


### IP Addresses

### Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

- The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management
  protocol used on Internet Protocol networks whereby a DHCP server dynamically
  assigns on IP address and other configuration parameters to each device on a
  network so they can communicate with other IP networks.


1. Typically, a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server would
   dynamically assign IP addresses to devices on the network.

2. In the absence of a DHCP server, a computer needs to be manually assigned an
   IP address, or it can use a special link local IP address to allow
   communication on the local network.
