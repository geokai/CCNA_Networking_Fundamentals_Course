## A bit of networking history


   ### A Computer Network
   A computer network is digital telecommunications network for sharing resorces
   between nodes, which are computing devices that use a common
   telecommunications technology.
   Data transmission between nodes is supported over data links consisting of
   physical cable media, such as twisted pair or fibre-optic cables, or by
   wireless methods, such as Wi-Fi, microwave transmission, or free-space
   optical communication.

1. Etherenet networking started with 10Base5 cabling - very thick coaxial calbe,
   very hard to work with due to the thickness and stiffness of the cable.
   Connections to the cable had to be made at predifined points on the cable,
   identified by markings on the surface of the cable.
   The connection was made using a _cable tap_ or _vampire tap_; a device
   that clamped onto the cable, piercing it to the core conductor. This pierced
   connection has to be made very carefully to ensure a sound and robust contact
   with the main conductor.
   The cable connector was very large and bulky.
   From the clamp connector, a _drop cable_ was required to connect to the
   computer. This cable too was very difficult to work with, it also being very
   thick and stiff.
   The drop cable then connected to the network interface card of the computing
   device.
   The main (coaxial) cable formed a _bus_ topology network that all the devices
   connected to.
   The 10Base5 networking system was commonly known as 'Thicknet' due to the
   cable thickness.

2. 10Base2 followed, utilising a thin coaxial cable, but following otherwise in
   the _bus_ topology of its' predecessor.
   It was, however, much easier to work with. This system was known as
   'Thinnet'.

3. Next came the copper twisted pair cables, cat-5 and cat-6, optical cables,
   and wireless connectivity.
   Cat-5 utp consists of four pairs of twisted copper wire terminating in a RJ45
   connector.
   Cat-6 is the shielded version of cat-5. Each twisted pair is shielded, then
   the a further shielding is used around the pairs, and the RJ45 connector is
   also shielded. This alows the cable to handle higher transfer rate of data.
   All forms of connectivity methods require a network interface card which has
   a _burnt-in_ unique identification number known as a MAC address. This
   unique id is used for addressing within the network telecommunications system.
