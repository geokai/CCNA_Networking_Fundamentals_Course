## 3.11 Servers, Clients, Ports, and Protocols


### What is a Server?

- In computing, a server is a computer program or a divice that provides
  functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients".

- This architecture is called the client-server model, and a single overall
  computation is distributed across multiple processes or devices.

### What is a Client?

- A client is a piece of computing hardware or software that accesses a sevice
  made available by a server.

- The server is often on another computer system, in which case the client
  accesses the service by way of a network.

1. Any computer can act as both a server or a client.
   Typically, a dedicated server will primarily provide services to clients.

2. The different services a server provides will be provided via specific
   'ports'.
   Each port 'listens' for a particular service requests by way of a specific
   protocol for that service.

3. Examples of specific services and their port numbers are:

    HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Used Port 80.

    HTTPS: Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. Uses Port 443

    FTP: File Transfer Protocol. Uses Port 21 (and 20).
